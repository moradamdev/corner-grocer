Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project was to build an item tracker for the Corner Grocer. The problem that needed to be solved was that there needed to be a way to track inventory in a grocery store. There needed to be a way to see how often customers were buying certain items and track the items that sell a lot.

What did you do particularly well?
  I think I did the UI in the menu particularily well. The program is very easy to use and functions as intended. There are also extra things that I added to make sure the user is entering proper prompts for the menu.
  
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  There were some places in the code that I could have optimized. For example, Some of the code was reused in certain parts. I reused code and slightly modified it for the histogram feature when I could have made another function to call instead and pass in different parameters to modify it instead.
  
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  It was challnging to write the second function that had to display the item name, and the amount of times it was sold. I had to make three different vectors which I feel is very suboptimal. I could have definitely done it with two, or maybe even one, but I was a little strapped for time.
  There is always room for improvement in any code, so maybe I'll go back to this and fix it.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Using vectors and modifying strings are two skills that will always be transferable to other projects and I will be using them for a long time to come.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  I split every feature in the program into different functions that will be very easy to change in the future. I also added plent of comments throughout my code to give more context as to what lines do certain things and I used standard formatting and camelcase to make it widely understood.
